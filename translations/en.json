    "lang-bach-s1-1": "This first semester was a wake-up call in terms of education, feeling that coming from my secondary I wasn't as prepared for the demands in certain subjects. I was very enthusiastic about the algebra course because Professor Eduardo Guerrero Miranda gave us a mathematics primer that sparked my curiosity for math. However, on the other hand, subjects like Biology or History felt overloaded with content that I thought I wouldn't be able to handle, not only in this semester but also in the continuation of these subjects in the next semester.",

Taught by Professor Eduardo Guerrero Miranda, the course was dynamic and sometimes frantic, but in my opinion, it was always interesting, where we learned the basics of algebra, including equations, fractions, factorization, and other topics that, from my perspective, were very well taught by the teacher.",
    "lang-bach-s1-algb-2": "With Professor Eduardo, I will feel eternally grateful for teaching me this course because through it, I understood mathematics after nine years of studying them without much enthusiasm, as I didn't know their use, comprehension, and application until this course. It was thanks to him that I became interested and passionate about them, so much so that even the professor himself noticed, pointing me towards an internal mathematics competition and motivating me to participate in larger competitions such as the mathematics olympiads, which I ended up participating in during the fourth semester of my high school (along with the support of another friend I met later on).",

Cellular Biology was very difficult, the memorization here didn't feel pointless. We studied cellular structure (which, although there may be few organelles, I found it very cumbersome to learn all this) but we linked this with how each organelle participated in cellular functions when we reached this topic, so it was constantly progressing needing the previous knowledge.",
    "lang-bach-s1-biol-2": "The subject was taught to me by the great teacher Eduardo Alvarado Villalobos, who provided us with a lot of information and very clear explanations about Cellular Biology. His classes were very dynamic, and the way he explained and clarified our doubts was always very helpful for the entire class. I believe he was one of the main pillars for all the colleagues who specialized in natural sciences related to biology.",

    "lang-bach-s2-etim-2": "The course was taught by Professor Mary Antonia Montes, and I must say it was a good course. I feel like I learned to try to understand more than memorize the etymological roots of words, associating words that have similar prefixes or suffixes (or other structures) and thus associating the meaning of that etymological structure.

We covered many topics related to Spanish, such as language functions, some literary devices, and other topics that I think were perfectly addressed, as well as reading works like \"The Widower RomÃ¡n\", \"Tomochic\", and \"White Nights\".

It's one of the best experiences I had, both in terms of education, thanks to the high quality of teachers, and socially. Without drifting away from my close friends from high school, I also met many more people whom I still consider close friends. The entire group of the International Baccalaureate, my \"IB Brothers\" were and continue to be my inspiration to work hard. Moreover, regardless of the educational program I'm talking about, I met incredible individuals, unique friends, people I hold dear and still cherish to this day.",

I experienced what I call \"my prime\" during this period, managing to work at high performance and with good efficiency throughout the semesters, even with very low sleep averages. I know that \"my prime\" remained in that stage because I now value sleep a lot, and although I may not return to that level of performance, I much prefer good rest nowadays.",

We were no longer in high school for seven hours, but for nine, meaning we went from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on campus in classes.

He's not a bad teacher by any means (at least I don't consider him one), but I think he leaves a large part of the learning to the student themselves. Considering that biology subjects in my first year of high school weren't my strength, it was even more challenging here. Despite all the studying I did, I never managed to score an exam in this subject (neither this semester nor in any of the subsequent ones) with a grade higher than 7 out of 10.",

One such project was the Group 4 Project, or abbreviated as P4. This project involved addressing a problem using the knowledge areas of Group 4 of the International Baccalaureate, which encompass the experimental sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics.",
    "lang-bi-s4-3": "Thus, we also began to work on significant individual projects, such as the development of the Extended Essay, a mini-thesis of 4,000 words on a specific topic using appropriate scientific methodology. This essay was one of the greatest challenges of the Diploma Programme. All of this was done while studying the topics that would be assessed in the External Assessments, the final exams of the programme, which conclude the International Baccalaureate studies.",

Professor LÃ¡riz was a good chemistry teacher with a good rapport with his students and a good way of explaining chemistry topics, among which we covered chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, and an introduction to organic chemistry.",
    "lang-bi-s4-chem-2": "The only thing I would point out is that it didn't adhere much to the Diploma Programme, which meant that we covered topics from Higher Level Chemistry that we weren't supposed to study, and we skipped essential topics from Standard Level Chemistry. It was chaotic when we realized this, and we would feel the consequences in future semesters. However, it's also worth mentioning that here, in the records submitted to the International Baccalaureate Organization as High School and Secondary Center of the U.A.A., we had the option to take Diploma assessments, choosing either Standard Level Chemistry or an Arts subject. This choice would divide the group for the next semester, either continuing with this subject or switching to Arts, depending on individual preference.",

Certainly, the more we advanced, the more I understood and enjoyed her classes. In this semester, we read 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde to discuss it and review some of the questions addressed in this subject in both Internal and External Assessments.",

However, most of the class time was used for the Group 4 project (P4) or for the CAS project planning. Sometimes, we planned CAS session activities that we would later deliver, or in the different teams of the P4 (where I was part of the Physics team), we devised the project we would undertake (that we as proud mexicans, decided to use prickly pear cactus for biogas production) and the diverse activities that the P4 teams would do.",

This made the learning somewhat self-taught and since I would really like to have many subjects, especially the most theoretical ones, which is read at home, resolve doubts in class. So personally I really liked this subject. It was very, very heavy, but the teacher showed a broad mastery of linear algebra topics in addition, what he told us was evident about having prepared the class so much since the holidays prior to these classes. Even he helped us a lot by giving us a lot of extra-class advice at other times, even in untimely weeks.",

I was embarrassed to have to struggle with my burnout while working with the guys at Hermes, especially in this semester where it was already difficult for me to stay in front of the computer during classes and then finish to continue programming.

If we were already doing practical activities in class, the professor would twist them slightly to make them a bit more complex but enough to demonstrate if we had indeed learned; memorization was not enough, we had to understand what we were doing, sometimes how to correctly compromise the professor's computer, or analyze network traffic with the proper reasoning to draw conclusions.
